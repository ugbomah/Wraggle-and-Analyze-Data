    "# Report On Data Wrangling Steps: Gather, Assess, and Clean\n",
    "## By: Ifeoma Ugbomah\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrangle Report:\n",
    "The dataset wrangle in the project is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also\n",
    "known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a twitter account that rates people’s dogs with humorous comment about the dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WeRateDogs Twitter project goals included:\n",
    "* Wrangling the twitter data through the following processes:\n",
    "* Gathering Data\n",
    "* Assessing Data\n",
    "* Cleaning Data\n",
    "* Storing, analyzing and visualizing your wrangled data\n",
    "* Reporting on the data wrangling efforts and data analyse and visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gathering Data:\n",
    "My wrangling efforts for the WeRateDogs Twitter project included gathering data from the\n",
    "following sources:\n",
    "* The WeRateDogs Twitter archive. The twitter_archive_enhanced.csv file was\n",
    "provided to Udacity students (“like me”). This archive contains basic tweet data\n",
    "(tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on\n",
    "August 1, 2017.\n",
    "* The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or another object, animal,\n",
    "etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file was provided\n",
    "to Udacity students (“Like me”).\n",
    "* Twitter API and Python's Tweepy library to gather each tweet's retweet count and\n",
    "favorite (\"like\") count at minimum, and any additional data I find interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessing Data:\n",
    "Once the data was gathered, I began to assess the data on both quality and tidiness issues.\n",
    "### Quality Issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Timestamp is not in correct datetime format\n",
    "\n",
    "* Delete retweet\n",
    "\n",
    "* Drop unnecessary columns (in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, retweeted_status_timestamp, expanded_urls)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Erroneous datatype tweet_id for tweet (combined twitter_archive, tweet_json) and tweet_id for image_prediction table\n",
    "\n",
    "* Source column should be categorical datatype\n",
    "\n",
    "* Wrong name like `a` and `None` (naming issues)\n",
    "\n",
    "* p1_conf, p2_conf and p3_conf is decimal in image prediction table\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some name in the p1, p2, p3 columns are capitalize\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidiness Issue:\n",
    "* Merge the `twitter archive`, and `tweet json` dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two columns in `twitter archive` table (rating_numerator and rating_denominator) combine to one (ratings)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two variable in the timestamp column (date and time).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create new dog type column with doggo,floofer,pupper,puppo as its values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Data:\n",
    "After the assessment, I cleaned the data through the following means:\n",
    "Define, Code and Test:\n",
    "* Merge the clean versions of twitter_archive, and tweet_json dataframes.\n",
    "* Create one column for the various dog types: doggo, floofer, pupper, puppo Remove columns no longer needed: in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id, and retweeted_status_timestamp.\n",
    "* Delete retweets.\n",
    "* Remove columns no longer needed.\n",
    "* Change tweet_id from an integer to a string.\n",
    "* Change the timestamp to correct datetime format.\n",
    "* Correct naming issues and Standardize dog ratings."
